        <p class="work-article__content">
            The original frontend for Dreams was written using dated techniques that were causing page
            loading times to be too high for our visitors. The decision was made to rewrite the front
            end using VueJS. We have been rewriting the front end to improve speed and stability. Unit
            testing was introduced during this process, playing a key role in improving overall coding
            standards.

        <h2>Benchmarking Tool</h2>

        <p class="work-article__content">
            Using NodeJS, an internal website speed testing tool has been developed to help monitor
            changes to our staging site before pushing live. This helps with communicating with the
            wider business.

            Results are stored in a MS SQL database and retrieved with an HTML front

            Developed in PHP, the aim of this project is to recreate key landing pages using Google's
            HTML framework. This improves core metrics, including site loading times, which in turn
