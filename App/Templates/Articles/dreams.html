    <h2>Vue JS</h2>

    <p>
        The original frontend for Dreams was written using dated techniques that were causing page
        loading times to be too high for our visitors. The decition was made to rewrite the front
        end using VueJS. We have been rewriting the front end to improve speed and stability. Unit
        testing was introduced during this process, playing a key role in improing overal coding
        standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Benchmarking Tool</h2>

    <p>
        Using NodeJS, an internal website speed testing tool has been developed to help monitor
        changes to our staging site before pushing live. This help with communicating to the
        wider business.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results are stored in a MS SQL database and retrieved with HTML front
        end using NodeJS.

    <p>
        Develped in PHP, the aim of this project is to recreate key landing pages using Google's
        HTML framework. This improves core metrics including site loading times, which in turn
        drive more mobile trafic.
